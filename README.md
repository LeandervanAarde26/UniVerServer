An application leveraging C# `dotnet` to provide services to perform **CRUD** functionality for a University, 
Limited to the following features:
- Users.
- Roles.
- Internal events. 
- Subjects. 
- Courses.

1. [Dotnet](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/)
   2. The dotnet CLI and SDK are recommended
2. [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/)

##### **Text Editor/ IDE**
In order to compile this project solution, it is *recommended* that you use one of the below IDE's/Text editors or editor of your choosing:
- [Visual studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)

   cd <your/path/to/project/UniverServer> 
   ```
3. Restore the project locally
   ```shell
   dotnet restore 
   ```
4. Ensure your local Postgres is running and you have a database initialised:
   1. You can use a Db GUI for this such as 
      1. [DataGrip](https://www.jetbrains.com/datagrip/)
      2. [PGAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/)
      3. [TablePlus](https://tableplus.com/)
5. Setup [UserSecrets](https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2024/01/11/connect-dotnet-app-external-postgresql-database)
